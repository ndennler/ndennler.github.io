<b>CSCI 445: Introduction to Robotics, at University of Southern California</b><br />
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br />
I provided instruction on topics related to using sensors, effectors, basic control theory, control architectures, localization, and motion planning.
</p>

<p>
<b>RBE 3002: Unified Robotics IV, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</b><br />
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br />
I provided instruction on topics related to differential drive kinematics, probabilistic state estimation (Kalman Filters, Particle Filters), and optimal path planning. The end project for this course was to create a robot that autonomously mapped and localized itself in a maze.

<p>
<b>RBE 3001: Unified Robotics III, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</b><br />
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br />
I provided instruction on topics related to forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, controls, and dynamics of robotic arms. We also covered computer vision techniques, with the end project being <a href="https://youtu.be/BBPJMZfkOqI">a robotic arm that sorts colored weights</a>.
