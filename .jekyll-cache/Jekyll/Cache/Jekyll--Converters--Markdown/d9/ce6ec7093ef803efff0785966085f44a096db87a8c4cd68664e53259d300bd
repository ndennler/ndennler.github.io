I"¸<p>Just before we went into quarantine, I was designing clothes to be shown in a fashion show run by the USC Fashion Industry Association. We planned the theme for the fashion show to be black-and-white so we could incorporate several looks from the members of the club. We were fortunate to work with both photographers from the photography club and aspiring models who were also students at USC. Here are some of the looks I created!</p>
