I"¨<p>As part of my humanities requirement at my undergraduate instutution, Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute, we were tasked with deeply pursuing (taking four classes) 
in one area. My area of focus was in art, and specifically computer animation 
and 3D modeling. As part of the final requirement, we needed to take a capstone 
class. I was particularly drawn to the class ‚Äúlight art‚Äù since it was the natural
progression of taking virtual art to the physical world.</p>
