I"A<p>Context: Whacking (originally punking) is a dance that originated in Los Angeles in the late 1960’s and 70’s in the gay clubs. It is a dance about expressing things that could not be expressed outwardly at that time. There is a rich and interesting history surrounding the dance. One of the originators of the dance, Viktor Manoel, resides in Los Angeles and teaches several online classes about the history of the dance. I will make a more in-depth blog post about whacking at some point, but until then I recommend the <a href="TODO: Fill OUT">wikipedia page</a>.</p>
