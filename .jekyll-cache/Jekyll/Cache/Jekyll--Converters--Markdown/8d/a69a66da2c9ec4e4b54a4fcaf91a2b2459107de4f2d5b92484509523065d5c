Around the time of the 2022 Winter Olympics, a previous member of USC figure skating referred me to an instagram post that was calling for a figure skater to do a small commercial for a streetwear clothing brand. My friend said she immediately thought of me when she head that the skating would be happening in a bear costume. Many skaters shy away from costumes that can possibly throw off your balance (and maybe I should have too), but I was enthusiastic anyway.</p>
