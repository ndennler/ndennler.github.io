I"X<p>To keep myself occupied during quarantine, I developed a few sewing projects to keep myself busy, which I referred to as the “Quarantine Quoture” collection (I love a good alliteration). These pieces don’t really have a common theme other than being made during quarantine, but they were a fun exploration of different techniques!</p>
