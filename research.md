      alt: image of several robots aligned in order from most abstract dog to most literal dog. The robots from left to right are Domgy, KK-8, Aibo (1999), and Aibo.
    description: The physical design of a robot suggests expectations of that robotâ€™s functionality for human users and collaborators. When those expectations align with the true capabilities of the robot, interaction with the robot is enhanced. This work evaluates user expectations through the use of design metaphors as applied to a wide range of robot embodiments.

    description: This work introduces an approach for automatic hair combing by a lightweight robot. For people living with limited mobility, dexterity, or chronic fatigue, combing hair is a difficult task that can negatively impact personal routines. We propose a modular system for enabling general robot manipulators to assist with a hair-combing task.

    description: Children and adults with cerebral palsy can have involuntary and undesired upper limb movements, leading to difficulties in communicating with caretakers and peers. We describe how a socially assistive robot may help individuals with CP to practice non-verbal communicative gestures using an active orthosis in a one-on-one number-guessing game.
