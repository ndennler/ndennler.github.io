      alt: image of several robots aligned in order from most abstract dog to most literal dog. The robots from left to right are Domgy, KK-8, Aibo (1999), and Aibo.
    description: The physical design of a robot suggests expectations of that robotâ€™s functionality for human users and collaborators. When those expectations align with the true capabilities of the robot, interaction with the robot is enhanced. My work in this area evaluates how user expectations are formed through physical robot design.
  - title: Robot Systems for Physical Assistance

    description: This area of work focuses on assisting users with limited mobility with daily tasks. In particular, we introduced an approach for automatic hair combing by a lightweight robot. Hair combing has been a previously unexplored task where robots can partially assist with direct user input. We proposed a modular system for enabling general robot manipulators to assist with a hair-combing task.
  - title: Combining Social and Physical Assistance for Engaging Physical Therapy

    description: This research area focuses on combinging insights from physical assistance and social expectations to create interactions that aid in rehabilitation processes. In one work, we described how a socially assistive robot may help individuals with CP practice non-verbal communicative gestures using an active orthosis in a one-on-one number-guessing game, and described how robots can adapt their personality to increase engagment throughout the interaction.
