## Teaching

<p>
<b>CSCI 566: Deep Learning and Its Applications, at University of Southern California</b><br>
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br>
I provided instruction on topics related to deep learning, starting with the basics of backpropagation, gradient descent, recurrent layers, and convolutional layers. We then teach students how to apply these concepts to computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
</p>

<p>
<b>CSCI 445: Introduction to Robotics, at University of Southern California</b><br>
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br>
I provided instruction on topics related to using sensors, effectors, basic control theory, control architectures, localization, and motion planning.
</p>

<p>
<b>RBE 3002: Unified Robotics IV, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</b><br>
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br>
I provided instruction on topics related to differential drive kinematics, probabilistic state estimation (Kalman Filters, Particle Filters), and optimal path planning. The end project for this course was to create a robot that autonomously mapped and localized itself in a maze.
</p>

<p>
<b>RBE 3001: Unified Robotics III, at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</b><br>
<i>Teaching Assistant</i><br>
I provided instruction on topics related to forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, controls, and dynamics of robotic arms. We also covered computer vision techniques, with the end project being <a href="https://youtu.be/BBPJMZfkOqI">a robotic arm that sorts colored weights</a>.
