<p>
  I am Nathan Dennler, a Human-Robot Interaction researcher. I received my PhD from the University of Southern California, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/">Stefanos Nikolaidis</a> and <a href="http://maja-mataric.web.app">Maja Matarić</a>. My research moves toward a future where users can quickly and efficiently adapt generic robots to align with their individual preferences, values, and needs. 
</p>

<p>
  I address this problem through two research directions to align robots with users' preferences: (1) learning user models and robot policies through implicit communication (e.g., interface interactions, engagement, or robot design) and (2) developing data-efficient algorithms that allow users to quickly and intuitively customize robot policies. I evaluate my approaches using real robots that interact with real users to address real problems—especially assistive robots for users with limited mobility. For a complete listing of my work, head over to my <a href="/research">Research page</a>. I also enjoy building open-source tools (e.g., <a href="https://pylips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyLips</a> and <a href="https://interaction-lab.github.io/robot-metaphors/">The MUFaSAA Dataset</a>) to support robotics researchers and hobbyists.
</p>

<p>
  I previously received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Robotics Engineering from <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>. In my spare time, you can find me find me figure skating at Yerba Buena, designing and sewing garments in my living room, running around the streets of the Castro, or whacking/waacking/punking in any of the aforementioned spaces. If you want to see me do any of these things (and more!), check out my <a href="/miscellany">Miscellany page</a>.
