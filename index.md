  I am Nathan Dennler, a full-stack roboticist. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology advised by <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~abobu/">Andreea Bobu</a>. My research enables end users to intuitively specify optimization problems that, when solved, result in robot behaviors that align with the user's specific preferences. I ground the algorithms I develop in manipulation, rehabilitation, and socially assistive applications where real robots interact with real users. 

  I address this problem through three pillars: (1) learning human-aligned robot representations from observed user behaviors, (2) identifying constraints through interaction to reduce search complexity, and (3) creating human-in-the-loop optimization algorithms that quickly find a user's preferred robot behaviors in noisy settings. For a complete listing of my work, head over to my <a href="/research">Research page</a>. I also enjoy building open-source tools (e.g., <a href="https://pylips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyLips</a> and <a href="https://interaction-lab.github.io/robot-metaphors/">The MUFaSAA Dataset</a>) to support robotics researchers and hobbyists.

  I am on the academic job market for the 2025-2026 cycle!

  I previously received my PhD from the University of Southern California, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/">Stefanos Nikolaidis</a> and <a href="http://maja-mataric.web.app">Maja Matarić</a>. Before that, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Robotics Engineering from <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>. In my spare time, you can find me find me figure skating at Johnson Athletic Center, designing and sewing garments in my living room, running along the Charles, or whacking/waacking/punking in any of the aforementioned spaces. If you want to see me do any of these things (and more!), check out my <a href="/miscellany">Miscellany page</a>.
