<p>
  Hello hello! I am Nathan Dennler, a Ph.D. Candidate studying Human-Robot Interaction at the University of Southern California. I reside in the <a href="https://icaros.usc.edu/">Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotics (ICAROS) Lab</a> and the <a href="https://uscinteractionlab.web.app/">Interaction Lab</a>. I am co-advised by <a href="https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/">Stefanos Nikolaidis</a> and <a href="http://maja-mataric.web.app">Maja Matarić</a>. I explore the ways in which robots can adapt to different end-users to maximally align with their social and functional goals. 
</p>

<p>
  I address this problem in two key ways: (1) through the identification of differences in users' preferences, and (2) through algorithmic methods to allow robots to adapt to users' preferences. I have previously explored how differences in robot design can shape users' expectations of how robots should behave. I have also developed methods to allow users with limited mobility to specify preferences for robots to comb their own hair as well as identifying clusters of users who preferred similar behavior to aid with physical therapy games for users with cerebral palsy.
</p>

<p>
  I previously received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Robotics Engineering from <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>. In my spare time, you can find me find me figure skating in Pasadena, designing and sewing garments in my living room, running around the streets of LA, or whacking/waacking/punking in any of the aforementioned spaces. If you want to see me do any of these things (and more!), check out my Miscellany section!
